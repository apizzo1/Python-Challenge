# Python-Challenge

Notes on PyParagraph:
1. Main.py runs analysis on paragraph_1.txt. Main2.py runs analysis on paragraph_2.txt - both analyses have their own output files

2.For the example given in the instructions, I am considering words with hyphens as one word - therefore, my code yields 120 words (same as if Microsoft Word were to count the words in this text snippet.This is important for paragraph_2 analysis, for words such as "career-defining" being identified as one word in word count.

3. For Paragraph 2, comparing to the results Erwins posted in Slack, my code returns slightly different numbers. I only see 10 sentences, and that is what my code returns. I also have a slightly different word count, which is the same as what Microsoft Word shows.
