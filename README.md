# Python-Challenge

Notes on PyParagraph:
1. For the example given in the instructions, I am considering words with hyphens as one word - therefore, my code yields 120 words (same as if Microsoft Word were to count the words in this text snippet.

2. For Paragraph 2, comparing to the results Erwins posted in Slack, my code returns slightly different numbers. I only see 10 sentences, and that is what my code returns. I also have a slightly different word count, which is the same as what Microsoft Word shows.
